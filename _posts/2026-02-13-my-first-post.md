Hello world! Welcome to my new cybersecurity journal. 

I've set up this blog to document my journey, share my notes, and write about all things network security.

### What's Next?
In the coming weeks, I plan to post about:
1. TryHackMe and HackTheBox walkthroughs
2. Packet analysis with Wireshark
3. Setting up a secure home lab

Here is a quick test of a code block to make sure my scripts will look good:

\`\`\`bash
# Running a basic Nmap scan
nmap -sV -sC 10.10.10.1
\`\`\`

Stay tuned!
