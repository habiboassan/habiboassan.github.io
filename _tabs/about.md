Hi there! 👋 I'm **Habib Naado**.

Welcome to **Naado's-Cyber-Journal**. I created this space to document my journey in cybersecurity, share insights, and write about the fascinating world of securing networks. 

### What You'll Find Here
I write about a variety of topics, including:
* **Network Security:** Analyzing packets, securing protocols, and understanding traffic.
* **Capture The Flag (CTF):** Walkthroughs, challenges, and lessons learned.
* **Tool Deep-Dives:** Exploring the tools of the trade (Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, etc.).
* **Security News:** My thoughts on recent vulnerabilities and industry trends.

### My Background
> "Securing the Web, One Packet at a Time."

I am currently focusing on API vulnerabilities and Web security. I believe that continuous learning is the most critical skill in cybersecurity.
